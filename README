Linuxrc
=======

Linuxrc is a program used for setting up the kernel for installation purposes.
It allows the user to load modules, start an installed system, a rescue
system or an installation via YaST.

Linuxrc is designed to be as small as possible. Therefore, all needed programs
are linked directly into one binary and linuxrc is compiled as a.out. So there
is no need for shared libraries in the initdisk and there is space for up to
100 kernel modules on a single bootdisk.

WARNING: **** NEVER RUN LINUXRC ON AN INSTALLED SYSTEM AS ROOT!! *****

Installation:
=============

Linuxrc can be compiled by simply typing "make" in the source directory. If
you want to upgrade to a newer version of the pcmcia package, you'll have to
adapt the new sources into the directory pcmcia. Also, the configuration
files config.h and config.mk need to be updated when switching to a newer
kernel release.

The layout of the initdisk is as follows:

Todo:
=====

Documentation ;-)
General improvements in all repects. Linuxrc is subject to be heavily modified
in the future. In the beginning there was just a little kernel patch...

Use and modify at your own risk. Modified versions of linuxrc are not supported
by S.u.S.E. GmbH! Linuxrc has not yet been tested with kernel releases 2.1.xx.

Have a lot of fun.
